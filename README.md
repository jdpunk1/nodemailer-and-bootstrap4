# nodemailer-and-bootstrap4
A node build using bootstrap 4's carousel example and including nodemailer to setup a contact email. 
Makes for a quick and easy homepage template..
I generated my mail client on mailgun, you'll need to paste in the api key, and domain as well as the custom email adresses you'd like to use in the nodemailer controller
run 'npm install' to install node packages
then 'set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start' to launch (windows cli).
